BIND is a grunge-fantasy tabletop RPG core ruleset.

# Rules

All rules are geared towards fast resolutions and player choices.

- One roll combat resolutions:
    * Attack and defence are the same roll.
    * If you miss, the enemy damages you.
    * No initiative rolls - just go!
    * Whoever has the most Action Points can interrupt and demand to go first.
- GMs don't roll much, so they can focus on orchestration.
- Spellcasters spend Mana Points.
- Character creation takes 15 minutes.
    * Roll a random race and Attributes.
    * Pick a 2-word concept.
    * Spend your XP on Skills.
- Leave the backstory till the game starts.
    * Spend your 5 Story Points to introduces allies, safe locations, and languages from your past.
    * When your character dies, pick one of the allies introduced through another story, and go from there.
