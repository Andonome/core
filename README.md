BIND is an open-source, grunge-fantasy, tabletop RPG, which:

- optimizes the crap out of everything (in ways you probably won't notice),
- is an 'adult game' (meaning we all have jobs, and need to set-up-and-go without homework or very much prep),
- will never have any house rules (because anyone can change the source files and reprint the PDF).

# Getting the Book

Download it from the [link][core], then take it to your local, friendly, print-shop.
Everything in the book has been optimized for reading on paper, and reading two-columns of blinding-white PDF on a monitor will only give you a headache.

To compile the books with LaTeX, check the setup in the [wiki][compiling].

# Related Books

- For a short introduction module, grab a copy of [the Goblin Hole][goblin_hole].  It comes with a running commentary of the rules, and pre-made character sheets, ready to be torn from the back.
- For character creation, print the [players' guide][stories].
- To craft your own section of a monster-ridden world, open the [Book of Judgement][judgement].

# Rules

All rules are geared towards fast resolutions and player choices.

- One roll resolves almost everything.
    * Roll `2D6 + Attribute + Skill + Bonus`.
        - Bonuses come from weapons, items, or the situation.
    * Players try to roll above the TN ('Tie Number') to achieve something, while avoiding some danger.
        - If they roll above the TN, they succeed.
        - If you roll below the TN, the danger occurs.
        - If you roll equal to the TN, they succeed *but* the danger also occurs.
    * Dice are never re-rolled.
        - If a different character tries the action, they must use the same dice roll.  So if the first character rolled a '5', the second will also have rolled a '5' (but a higher Bonus means they may still succeed).
- Combat works similarly.
    * In combat, attack and defence are the same roll.
        - If you miss, the enemy damages you.
        - Players spend Action Points to determine who goes first, and decide where their character is focussed.
- Spellcasters spend Mana Points.
- GMs don't roll often, so they can focus on interpretation and reaction.
