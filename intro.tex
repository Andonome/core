\subsection*{Overview}

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  BIND\footnote{`BIND' stands for `BIND is not D\&D'.} was an attempt to fix D\&D which got out of control.
  \item
  BIND is yet another fantasy RPG about killing ogres for gold pieces.
  \item
  BIND mechanics force a fast real-world resolution to every encounter.
  \item
  \ifnum\day=17
    BIND was made with too much hot sauce.
    \emph{I'm sorry, the bottle slipped!}
  \else
  BIND is an `adult game', meaning we all have jobs and such, so the game should make as few demands on everyone's time as possible.
  \fi
  \item
  BIND kills all house rules, by allowing people to integrate their own rules into the books, compiling their own pdf, and reprinting.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Context}

BIND splits information in a slightly different way to other RPGs.

A skeleton of the core rules exist in every adventure module.
This rule book contains extended systems which either explain the core rules with examples, and show using them for various sub-systems (in fact perhaps it should be called `BIND: Systems \& Explanations', but that's less catchy than `BIND: Core').

The adventure modules also contain their own price-lists in the form of handouts, so players can just take the page they want, on its own.
This stops the persistent problem at my table of players persistently figuring out how to buy weapons in the core rules (`is it under ``equipment'', or ``combat'', where the weapon tables are?').
Perhaps it solves the same problem at your table.

On a similar note, everything that players repeatedly try to reference sits in the \textit{Book of Stories}.
It has the rules on character creation, improving Traits, crafting backstories, and creating magical items and new spells.

Finally, the \textit{Book of Judgement} provides a high-level view of \gls{fenestra}'s guilds, beasts, and fiends; world-building material, and myriad random tables.
