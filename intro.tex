\subsection*{Overview}

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  BIND\footnote{`BIND' stands for `BIND is not D\&D'.} was an attempt to fix D\&D which got out of control.
  \item
  BIND is yet another fantasy RPG about killing ogres for gold pieces.
  \item
  BIND mechanics force a fast real-world resolution to every encounter.
  \item
  \ifnum\day=17
    BIND was made with too much hot sauce.
    \emph{I'm sorry, the bottle slipped!}
  \else
  BIND is an `adult game', meaning we all have jobs and such, so the game should make as few demands on everyone's time as possible.
  \fi
  \item
  BIND kills all house rules, by allowing people to integrate their own rules into the books, compiling their own pdf, and reprinting.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Context}

This book won't work alone.
The most important book to find, is an adventure module.
Seek out \textit{Escape from the Horde} if you don't have a module in mind.

This book covers the complete rules for action resolution.
Every other book references the rules here, but nobody needs to read this book from cover-to-cover --- it's only for reference.

If you're a player, have a look at the \textit{Book of Stories}.
It covers character creation, gaining \glsentryshortpl{xp}, and cultural notes on \gls{fenestra}.

If you're a GM, check out the \textit{Book of Judgement}.
It begins with building a map, then describes \gls{fenestra}'s ecology, with details on creatures, and per-season encounter tables.

BIND is open source, and available under the {\tt GNU General Public License 3} or (at your option) any later version.

BIND will never have any `house rules', because anyone can place their alterations directly into the book and make their rules official.
