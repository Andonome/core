\subsection*{Overview}

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  BIND\footnote{`BIND' stands for `BIND is not D\&D'.} was an attempt to fix D\&D which got out of control.
  \item
  BIND is yet another fantasy RPG about killing ogres for gold pieces.
  \item
  BIND mechanics force a fast real-world resolution to every encounter.
  \item
  BIND is an `adult game', meaning we all have jobs and such, so our games should demand as little homework as possible.
  \item
  BIND has no house-rules, and never will.
  Everyone has complete access to the files so you can just change the rules, and re-print the \gls{pdf}.

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Context}

This is a reference book for the BIND RPG.
So have a quick peak at all the sections in the table of contents, then go and get another book.

For players, the \textit{Book of Stories} has everything required to make a character.
It also has all the information that players typically ask about, like gaining \glspl{xp}, or creating new spells.

The \gls{gm} should print off a mission module, such as \textit{Escape from the Horde}, or print a copy of \textit{The Book of Judgement} in order to roll up their own patch of \gls{fenestra}, and read about the five main predators which stalk people who roam above the ground.

Every mission modules also contains its own price-lists in the form of handouts, so players can just take the page they want, on its own.
This stops my table's problem of players persistently figuring out how to buy weapons in the core rules (`is it under ``equipment'', or ``combat'', where the weapon tables are?').
Perhaps it solves the same problem at your table.
