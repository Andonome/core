\subsection*{Overview}

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  BIND\footnote{`BIND' stands for `BIND is not D\&D'.} was an attempt to fix D\&D which got out of control.
  \item
  BIND is yet another fantasy RPG about killing ogres for gold pieces.
  \item
  BIND is an `adult game', meaning we all have jobs and such, so our games should demand as little homework as possible.
  \item
  BIND will answer every question with $4D6$ or less, guaranteed.
  \item
  BIND has no house-rules, and never will.
  Everyone has complete access to the files so you can just change the rules, and re-print the \gls{pdf}.
  \glsadd{pdf}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Context}

BIND was designed to be easy to learn and snappy, with short rules at the start of each module, and one roll to resolve everything.
However, incomplete rules eventually lead to problems.

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  A player will ask about the limits of their character's abilities.
  Just how big a weapon can they use in one hand?
  \item
  Another will ask exactly what this or that \gls{skill} covers, and when it should be used.
  \item
  Players will want more Knacks and Spells for their characters.
  \item
  Every time players ask about trying something new in combat, the \gls{gm} has to make another ruling on the spot, and hope that the ruling won't cause problems later.
  \item
  Every time players ask about trying something new outside of combat, the same problem occurs.
  How do they make poisons?
  Or their own equipment?
\end{itemize}

These extended rules should be referenced when needed, to solve these problems.
