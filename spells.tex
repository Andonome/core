\noindent
The world has a consistent logic to its workings, which you might think of as a language.
A miracle-worker is someone who can speak sweetly to the logic of the world.

The language of the world has five nouns -- Water, Earth, Fire, Air, and \textit{Fate}.
Spellcasters can gain these as Skills in order to control these elements.

The language of the world has only four verbs -- Wax, Wane, Warp, and Witness.
Spellcasters cannot create or destroy, but they can make an element blossom or whither.
Each of these spells is a 'level one spell', and costs 1 \gls{mp} to cast.

The language of the world has four adjective, referred to by spellcasters as \textit{Enhancements}.
Each adjective increases the spell's level, and the spell's level can dramatically increase every Enhancements's effects.
Spellcasters find this dangerous cycle intoxicating.

Each of these `low spheres' can combine with another to form a `high sphere' -- a new noun which the caster can speak to, and affect.
Air and Fire create Light, Fire and Earth create Force.
Affecting these high spheres takes considerably more skill; the caster has a rating in each high sphere equal to the \emph{lowest} of the two low spheres which comprise it.

The primordial breath to speak this language comes from the wind, bringing inspiration to those who can listen.
Of course, spellcasters without the patience for inspiration often resort to just gutting a giant arachnid for its webbing, mixing in some griffin-feathers, and twisting the world by force.
A good witch leaves no part of her prey unused.

\spell{Forest Crown}% Name
  {}% Enhancements
  {Warp}% Action

  {The target hears how good they would look with antlers, and antlers start to grow.
  They grant +1 to Damage while using the Brawl Skill}% Description

\spell{Slashers}% Name
  {}% Enhancements
  {Warp}% Action
  {Earth, Water}% Spheres

  {target's \glspl{hp}}% Resist with
  {The caster lists how the target looks like a different race, and their features begin to shift to match}% Description

  The spell lasts until the target makes use of any characteristic of their own race.
  For humans, this means their ability to walk long-distances, and for gnomes it means trying to focus on anything.}

  {Earth, Water}% Spheres
