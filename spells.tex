\noindent
Magic can do any number of things, but like anything else, it has standards.
These standards are, of course, `spells'.

Spells of the `low spheres', directly affect their elements (Earth, Fire, Water, Air, or Fate).
They produce very powerful effects, but must affect people indirectly.
A fire spell might make fire explode in someone's face, but if that someone does not stand near a fire, then the Fire Sphere will not affect them, because most people are not made out of fire.

The `high spheres' (Death, Light, Life, Force, and Mind) each need two low spheres combined to cast their spells; level 2 Light magic requires Fire 2 and Air 2, and so on.
These high spheres tend to affect people much more directly, but with smaller effects.
Death spells will encourage the little seed of death which sits within us all, and Life magic can twist or prod anything which lives.

The primordial breath to speak the language of spells comes from the wind, bringing inspiration to those who can listen.
Of course, spellcasters without the patience for inspiration often resort to just gutting a giant arachnid for its webbing, mixing in some griffin-feathers, and twisting the world by force.
A good witch leaves no part of her prey unused.

\spell{Little Big}% Name
  {}% Enhancements
  {Warp}% Action
  {Fire, Air}% Spheres
  {\roll{Wits}{Vigilance}}% Resist with
  {The caster mixes a malaphor, and the target's size contorts like a funhouse mirror, inflicting a -\arabic{spellPlusOne} penalty to ranged attacks against them}% Description
  {A gnome seen from ten steps might appear to be the size of a human, or a human may appear the size of a gnome.
    The closer one approaches the target, the more normal it appears.}

\showSpells{Light1}

\spell{Shadow}% Name
  {}% Enhancements
  {Wane}% Action
  {Fire, Air}% Spheres
  {\roll{Wits}{Vigilance}}% Resist with
  {As the caster whispers, a single patch of darkness, the length of a step, forms anywhere within range}% Description
  {It can completely obscure a candle's light, and diminish a torch's light to the strength of a candle.

    The patch of shadow joins to a target.
    If cast on a person, the shadow remains attached to them, inflicting a -\arabic{spellPlusOne} penalty to noticing things (and becomes very irritating, very quickly).

    The shadow fades once sunlight touches it for \pgls{interval}.}

\subsection{Life}

\showSpells{Life1}

\spell{Forest Crown}% Name
  {}% Enhancements
  {Warp}% Action
  {Earth, Water}% Spheres
  {\roll{Strength}{Athletics}}% Resist with
  {The target hears how good they would look with antlers, and antlers start to grow.
  They grant +1 to Damage while using the Brawl Skill}% Description
  {
  The antlers will stop the target wearing a helmet, so they cannot wear Complete armour.
  The antlers shed over any cold season, or can be removed with a bone-knife.}

\spell{Slashers}% Name
  {}% Enhancements
  {Warp}% Action
  {Earth, Water}% Spheres
  {\roll{Strength}{Athletics}}% Resist with
  {The caster makes accusations of vile language, and the target grows needle-sharp claws.
  They grant +1 Damage when using Brawl, but inflict a -1 penalty to using weapons or other tools}% Description
  {
  The claws grow out naturally, or can be cut off at any time.}

\spell{Tweak}% Name
  {}% Enhancements
  {Warp}% Action
  {Earth, Water}% Spheres
  {target's \glspl{hp}}% Resist with
  {The caster lists how the target looks like a different race, and their features begin to shift to match}% Description
  {The target must have Attributes within the racial maximums and minimums of the target race, so a human with Strength +1 could become an elf, but Strength +3 would stop them looking remotely elf-like.

  The spell lasts until the target makes use of any characteristic of their own race.
  For humans, this means their ability to walk long-distances, and for gnomes it means trying to focus on anything.}

\spell{Regeneration}% Name
  {detailed}% Enhancements
  {Wax}% Action
  {Earth, Water}% Spheres
  {current lost \glspl{hp} + 7}% Resist with
  {The caster gathers tiny gifts for the target, and they begin to regenerate Damage faster, recuperating an extra \arabic{spellPlusOne} \glspl{hp} each week}% Description
  {During this time, the target's appetite grows substantially, and they need an extra \arabic{spellCost} meals every day to keep the spell going.}

\subsection{Mind}

\showSpells{mind1}

\spell{Shadow Check}% Name
  {}% Enhancements
  {Witness}% Action
  {Fate, Water}% Spheres
  {quiet thoughts}% Resist with
  {This spell tells the caster if any particular patch (and it has to be a specific patch) contains anything which has a mind}% Description
  {Shadows, statues, or suspicious bushes can all hide all manner of things.

    The spell will not say what kind of mind this is -- whether animal or person.
    It reports only `yes/ no', and often has false positives due to mice or insects (1/6 chance in daylight, 2/6 chance at night).}

  {carried items' total \gls{weight}}% Resist with

  {distant}% Enhancements
  {Wax}% Action
  {Earth, Fire}% Spheres
  {\roll{Speed}{Athletics}}% Resist with

  {}

\subsection{Life}

\showSpells{Life2}

\spell{Breaths in the Air}% Name
  {distant}% Enhancements
  {Witness}% Action
  {Earth, Water}% Spheres
  {target's strangeness}% Resist with
  {Focussing on the air, and sniffing the wind, the caster asks politely if it will say whether or not some creature sits around \spellRange\ away}% Description
  {Other humanoids are \tn[7] to detect, beasts are \tn[9], and stranger creatures present a greater challange.}

\subsection{Light}

\showSpells{Light2}

\spell{Shadow Puppet}% Name
  {detailed}% Enhancements
  {Wane}% Action
  {Fire, Air}% Spheres
  {\roll{Wits}{Vigilance}}% Resist with
  {One target shadow forms a detailed silhouette, and may even stand up and away from the ground}% Description
  {During the daylight, it simply appears very strange; but at night these shadow puppets can easily fool someone into thinking a monster, or even a particular person lies waiting, in the distance.

  The shadows disappear once bright light hits them.}

\pic{Roch_Hercka/elvish_enchanter}

\subsection{Mind}

\showSpells{Mind2}

\spell{Watchman}% Name
  {detailed}% Enhancements
  {Warp}% Action
  {Water, Fate}% Spheres
  {spell's level}% Resist with
  {The caster speaks to a spell, and convinces it to copy their own Code of belief.
  It gains Intelligence and Charisma Bonuses of -1}% Description
  {Casters use this spell to control illusions, to make water rage in one direction rather than another, to convince a large wind to leave their companions alone, or suggest to a curse spell the best time to spring a nasty surprise on the target.

  The caster must be able to sense the spell in order to address it, which often demands a \textit{Witness} spell come first.

  These spells tend to take advice from the caster for a while, but soon after make their own interpretations of what they want.}

  {The caster yells warnings, and the targets gain \gls{dr}~\arabic{spellCost} as their skin becomes thick}% Description
  {Unfortunately, the tough hide feels heavy, and effectively counts as an item with \pgls{weight} of \arabic{spellCost}.
  The hide usually comes with fur, and protects against the cold as well as Damage.

  When the spell combines with others, to boost the target's Strength and grant claws, they eventually look just like a regular bear.

  The strange skin fades to normal once the target takes Damage and heals.}
