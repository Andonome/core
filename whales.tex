You can call me Ishmail, because I'm gonna tell you about whales.

In Europe's 19th century, the whole world depended on one resource.
Men would travel to the other side of the world, then find and kill a Biblical monster.

\subsubsection{Some Whale Basics}

Whales are broadly divided into two kinds: toothed whales and baleen whales.
Toothed whales have teeth, baleen whales have a flexible filter-feeding system, also named baleen.
Baleen is derived from Latin \textit{balaena}, related to Greek \textit{phalaina}, all of which mean `whale', making `baleen whale' -- `whale whale'.

A notable whale species is sperm whale (like \textit{Moby Dick}, or Pearl from \textit{Sponge Bob}).
Inside its square head, there's a highly sought after liquid called spermaceti.
`Sperm whale' is actually short for `spermaceti whale'.
`Spermaceti' means `whale sperm'.
So `spermaceti whale' means `whale sperm whale'.
`Spermaceti' is a thick, waxy substance that is speculated to aid with bouyancy, however it cannot be confirmed because sperm whales hate us now.
But it definitely isn't sperm.

\subsubsection{Whalers}

Killing a whale is not a fun day.
Everyone who does it has to do it.
Bastards and other surplus -- men who have no apprenticeship, or inheritance -- have one clear path to make their living.
They board a whaling boat, and sail.

Once they have a whale in sight, they propel harpoons using gunpowder weapons, or their arms.
The side of their boat swivels out to provide a netted `shelf' to process the whale.

Once a whale is caught, the whalers must work fast and harvest as much as they can before the whale dies, and rot begins.
Some must walk on top of it, and hope to balance well enough to not fall into the icy-cold waters.
The whalers peel its skin like an orange, then extract and boil the blubber into whale oil.

Some whalers collect toothed whales' teeth and carve them to pass the time (it's either that or homoeroticism).

\subsubsection{Bountiful Corpses}

Whale meat gets harvested for food.
Bones are sometimes ground into fertilizer.
Sperm whales get scalped and have spermaceti extracted from the junk
(`junk' is the actual name of the part of their heads that houses the liquid).
Spermaceti is brought to land, where it's chilled over Winter, and later squeezed into sperm oil.
Solid leftovers were bleached and sold as spermaceti wax.

Baleen is also called `whalebone', despite being closer to nails or hair than bone in structure.
Baleen is harvested from the whale's mouth, and used wherever a thin flexible material can be used.
Most famously, it was used for clothes' construction -- corsets, stays, bustles, crinolines, et c.

Ambergris is fossilized bowel secretions of sperm whales.
It's speculated to be a reaction to bowel irritations.
