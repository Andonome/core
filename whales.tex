\chapter{The Bodies of Giants}

It's the 1800s, and the whole world depends on one resource.
The only way to get it -- go to the other side of the world, then find and kill a Biblical monster.
You can call me Ishmail, because I'm gonna tell you about whales.

\subsubsection{Some Whale Basics}

Whales are broadly divided into two kinds: toothed whales and baleen whales.
Toothed whales have teeth, baleen whales have a flexible filter-feeding system, also named baleen.
Baleen is derived from Latin \textit{balaena}, related to Greek \textit{phalaina}, all of which mean `whale', making `baleen whale' -- `whale whale'.

A notable whale species is sperm whale (like \textit{Moby Dick}, or Pearl from \textit{Sponge Bob}).
Inside its square head, there's a highly sought after liquid called spermacite.
`Sperm whale' is actually short for `spermacite whale'.
`Spermacite' means `whale sperm'.
So `spermacite whale' means `whale sperm whale'.
`Spermacite' is a thick, waxy substance that is speculated to aid with bouyancy, however it cannot be confirmed because sperm whales hate us now.
But it definitely isn't sperm.

\subsubsection{Whale Products}

Once a whale is caught, whalers peel its skin like an orange, and boil the blubber into whale oil.
Whale meat gets harvested for food.
Bones are sometimes ground into fertilizer

Sperm whales get scalped and have spermacite extracted from the junk
(`junk' is the actual name of the part of their heads that house the liquid).
Spermacite is brought to land, where it's chilled over Winter, and later squeezed into sperm oil.
Solid leftovers were bleached and sold as spermacite wax.

Baleen is also called `whalebone', despite being closer to nails or hair than bone in structure.
Baleen is harvested from the whale's mouth, and used wherever a thin flexible material can be used.
Most famously, it was used for clothes' construction -- corsets, stays, bustles, crinolines, et c.

Whalers collect toothed whales' teeth and carve them to pass the time (it's either that or homoeroticism).

Ambergris is fossilized bowel secretions of sperm whales.
It's speculated to be a reaction to bowel irritations.
