it's the 1800s. there's a resource the whole world depends on. only way to get it - on the other side of the world, find and kill a biblical monster

you can call me ishmail. because i'm gonna tell you about whales.

# some whale basics

whales are broadly divided into two kinds: toothed whales and baleen whales.
toothed whales have teeth (duh), baleen whales have a flexible filter-feeding system also named baleen.
baleen is derived from latin balaena, related to greek phalaina, all of which mean 'whale', making baleen whale - whale whale

a notable whale species is sperm whale (like moby dick, or pearl from sponge bob).
inside its square head, there's a highly sought after liquid called spermacite.
sperm whale is actually short for spermacite whale. spermacite means whale sperm. so spermacite whale is a whale sperm whale.
spermacite is a thick waxy substance that is speculated to aid with buyancy, however it cannot be confirmed because sperm whales hate us now.
but it definitely isn't sperm.

# whale products

once a whale is caught, whalers peel its skin like an orange, and boil the blubber into whale oil.
whale meat gets harvested for food. bones are sometimes ground into fertilizer

sperm whales get scalped and have spermacite extracted from the junk.
(junk is the actual name of the part of their heads that house the liquid, i swear.)
spermacite is brought to land, where it's chilled over winter, and later squeezed into sperm oil.
solid leftovers were bleached and sold as spermaceti wax.

baleen is also called whalebone, despite being closer to nails or hair than bone in structure.
baleen is harvested from the whale's mouth, and used wherever a thin flexible material can be used.
most famously, it was used for clothes construction - corserts, stays, bustles, crinolines etc.

whalers collect toothed whale's teeth and carve them to pass the time (it's either that or homoeroticism).

ambergris is fossilized bowel secretions of sperm whales. it's speculated to be a reaction to bowel irritations.



in 1590s, dutch explorers stumble upon whales while exploring the arctic, and promptly establish a monopoly on whaling for the next century. britain and france scramble to compete, going full throttle on colonization.
britain gets scammed into colonizing the bermudas by (false) promises of whales, ambergris and pearls. it took them over 50 years to catch their first whale.

so by the industrial revolution, multiple world powers have whaling industries, and whale products like whale oil
