\Gls{fenestra} does not sit well with our modern instincts.
We all understand that aeroplanes and cows have irrevocably changed the planet for the worse.
But in \gls{fenestra}, people fight against a cruel nature.
They burn the forest while celebrating every toppled tree.
They despise their own world.

And so naturally, the perspective-switch which \gls{fenestra} demands can feel unclean.
But you have to understand, their world feels very different.

We created cows through early genetic manipulation of the original animal -- the auroch.
By the 13th century, aurochs became extinct.

When people travelled during this era, they would only fear other humans.
They hated wolves for stealing their food, and in some parts of the planet, a few animals had the muscle and teeth to kill a few humans here and there\ldots at least those not paying attention, but no animal has every posed a real danger to humanity on the same level as diseases, starvation, or warfare.
No city ever disappeared because of large predators eating everyone.
Humanity has wandered the earth, fearlessly, selecting the best plots of land they could to grow all the food they wished, and fence in the meat.

Disease, starvation and war don't trouble the people in \gls{fenestra} much.
They have been replaced with the basilisk, chitincrawler, and woodspy.
Just as Europeans once considered the black death, and other plagues, a standard way to die, any market place in \gls{fenestra} will have updates on what ate whom recently.
This leaves that world very similar to ours on-balance, but very strange in all the details.

\begin{exampletext}
  A young man, who does random jobs to get by, with little pay, must dig a grave tonight.
  The town has no full-time grave-diggers, because most people do not leave a corpse.
\end{exampletext}

\begin{exampletext}
  Two men in a bar debate the usefulness of wearing a helmet.
  The first details the standard attacks from every predator, which mostly involve ambushes, and grabbing.

  \begin{speechtext}
    ``Helmets stop you spotting an attack.
    And they don't help when something grabs you.

    In fact, they make everything worse in every way, defending only against bandits.
    But bandits don't want to eat you, and they're much more timid than real predators, so you can pay them off if you need to.
    \emph{And} the helmet still stops you spotting the ambush.
  \end{speechtext}

  The interlocutor has a few good points on the other side, so the debate continues -- should soldiers wear helmets?
\end{exampletext}

\begin{exampletext}
  The newest recruit to the \gls{templeOfBeasts} arrives, tired, hungry, and pregnant.
  Not long before, most people who became pregnant would receive some dispensation to take time off, or would receive permission to work as \pgls{jotter} instead of fighting at the \gls{edge}.
  However, this lead to an explosion of pregnancies within the \gls{guard}, which lead to a group of the hardest bastards to walk \gls{fenestra}'s dark roads.
