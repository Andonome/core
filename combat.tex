\chapter[The Arena]{Combat}
\index{Combat}
\label{combat}

Don't roll for initiative!
Instead, each character's \textit{Speed} determines how many \glsentrylongpl{ap} they start with. 
Characters attack with any number of Resisted rolls, but generally use their \textit{Dexterity} and a Martial Skill.
With a standard attack, the winner of the Resisted roll then uses their \textit{Strength} to deal Damage.%
\footnote{Having one roll for a `clash' saves a lot of time.  Instead of rolling for `initiative, attack, dodge, attack, damage', players can just spend \pgls{ap} and attack.}

Combat will generally only last a couple of `rounds', during which the \glspl{pc} could take one action, or six, or even more, depending on circumstances and their Traits and equipment.

\section{Raw Combat}

\begin{multicols}{2}

\subsection{Attacking}
\label{attack}

Characters generally fight with a Resisted \roll{Dexterity}{Combat} roll, but any kind of Resisted roll works, as long as it makes sense.
In fact, a round of combat could easily go like this:

\begin{exampletext}
  Cleftrank charges towards the elven enchanter as the enchanter points behind Cleftrank, and asks `what is that thing, crawling over your shoulder?'.
  The player insists his character would ignore this and keep on charging, so the \gls{gm} allows him to resist with a charge, as he already began the assault.

  \small{(The \gls{gm} adds the enchanter's \roll{Charisma}{Mind} to the \gls{tn}, for a total \gls{tn} of 12; Cleftrank's player resists with his \roll{Speed}{Athletics}, and wins the roll)}

  My character swings his axe through the elf's jaw to shut him up.

  \small{(The elf continues attempting the enchantment spell, so the player rolls at \gls{tn} 12 again, but this time he uses \roll{Dexterity}{Combat}, and the axe costs 3~\glspl{ap} to use)}

  `Cleftrank looks behind himself for a moment, then checks his other behind, and somewhere in his confusion he spots the enchanter beside him, taking out a dagger.'

  \small{(Cleftrank loses the roll, so the enchantment spell strips him of 2~\glspl{ap}, which puts him at -1~\glspl{ap}; he cannot run away)}

  The enchanter drives the dagger down!

  \small{(If Cleftrank defends with the axe, it will cost him 3 more \glspl{ap}, putting him down to -4.
  He cannot deal with a -4 penalty, so he decides to use the Brawl Skill instead)}

  (The enchanter's \roll{Dexterity}{Combat} puts the \gls{tn} to 10.
  Cleftrank rolls his \roll{Dexterity}{Brawl} with a -1 penalty\ldots and wins)

  \small{(The elf buckles in pain from the kick, then turns to run)}

\end{exampletext}

When combat begins, roll your \roll{Dexterity}{Combat} against \tn[7], plus the enemy's \roll{Dexterity}{Combat}.
If you win, roll to see how much Damage you deal to the opponent.
If your opponent wins, the \gls{gm} rolls to see how much Damage your opponent deals you.
Finally, on a tie, you can decide to both take \emph{and} deal Damage, or neither.
In the former case, you and your opponent hit each other at the same time.
In the latter, blades clash but nobody gets hurt.

\subsection{Damage}
\index{Damage}

If you hit, roll $1D6$ plus your Strength Bonus to determine Damage.
The Damage is then taken off the enemy's \glspl{hp}.
Everyone has a number of \glspl{hp} to withstand Damage.
When they reach 0~\glspl{hp}, they fall over.

\subsubsection{Stacking Damage}
\index{Combat!Stacking Damage}
\label{stackingDamage}

Damage Bonuses cannot extend forever.
Replace every +4 Damage Bonus by an additional $D6$.
It continues through all Damage Bonuses, so $1D6+9$ Damage becomes $3D6+1$ Damage after conversion.

\subsubsection{\Glsfmtlongpl{hp}}

Each character has a number of \glsentryfullpl{hp} equal to 6 plus their Strength Bonus.
Small gnomes typically have 4~\glspl{hp} while big, strong humans typically have 7.
Losing even a single \gls{hp} means the character has suffered serious Damage.
A long fall might have broken the character's bone.
A dagger could have slashed veins open.
Characters do not have many \glspl{hp} so losing even one is a serious matter.

\index{Coins!\Glsfmtlongpl{hp}}
Players have a space on their character sheets to track \glspl{hp} using coins.
Having a physical representation of waning health lets the other players see their injuries at a glance.

\subsubsection{Death}
\index{Death}
\label{death}
Once a character reaches 0~\glspl{hp}, they fall over, and don't get up.
Anyone can attempt to save them by bandaging up their wounds, or staving off a concussion, with a \roll{Wits}{Medicine} roll.
The \gls{tn} is 7 plus the number of \glspl{hp} the character has fallen below 0, so someone at -3~\glspl{hp} would need a roll at \gls{tn} 10 to save.

\paragraph{If the healer rolls the \gls{tn} exactly,}
the character has survived, but with a permanent wound.
The players must select one Attribute, and give it a penalty equal to $1D6$.
If the Attribute falls below -5, the character dies.

A Charisma penalty might suggest a partly broken jaw, leading to a permanent speech impediment.
An Intelligence penalty might represent a brain-injury.

\paragraph{If the healer fails the roll,}
anyone else can have another attempt, but with a -1 penalty (bad healers can make the problem worse).
If nobody succeeds in the roll, the character dies.

\paragraph{A successful check}
means that the character is unconscious for the remainder of the \gls{interval}, but still alive.
At this point, the rest of the troupe will have to carry their fallen comrade back to safety -- if they can.%
\footnote{See page \pageref{weight} for \nameref{weight}.}

\subsection{\Glsfmtlongpl{ap} \& Initiative}
\label{actionPoints}
\index{Initiative}

Everyone begins combat with 3~\glsentryfullpl{ap} plus their Speed Bonus.%
\footnote{Anyone with a Speed Bonus of -3 can act on Initiative 0, but only once everyone else has reached Initiative 0.
Those with a lower Initiatives must wait one cumulative round extra, before acting.}
Every action requires spending some number of \glspl{ap}.
Once someone reaches 0~\glspl{ap}, they cannot initiate any actions, but they can still engage in any Resisted actions if attacked.

\subsubsection{Negative \Glsfmtlongpl{ap}}
Anyone overspending \glspl{ap} enters \emph{negative} \glspl{ap}, and receives a penalty to all actions equal to their negative score.

\begin{exampletext}
  A character on 2~\glspl{ap} who attacks with a greatsword (which costs 4~\glspl{ap}) would then go to -2~\glspl{ap}.
  If someone attacked them, they would have to respond with a -2 penalty to their action, then reduce to -6~\glspl{ap}.
  Using big weapons gives big bonuses, but they bring their own dangers!
\end{exampletext}

\subsubsection{Combat Order}
\index{Initiative}

ï»¿During combat, anyone may take actions without a set sequence\ldots until two characters vie for priority.
At that point use the following method to determine who goes first:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item
  Whoever currently has the most \glspl{ap}.
  \item
  Whoever is spending the \emph{least} \glspl{ap}.
  \item
  Whoever has the highest Speed Bonus.
  \item
  Whoever has the highest Wits Bonus.
  \item
  Dice roll! ($1D6$ each)
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{\Glspl{quickaction}}

\Glspl{quickaction} require spending an \gls{ap} immediately to react to a situation.
This includes getting attacked by someone or moving away from someone who approaches you.

Resolve priority upon simultaneous action with the Combat Order rules above.

\paragraph{Guarding}
\label{guarding}
allows any character to move up to 1~\gls{step}, position themselves in front of another player, and receive all attacks from their front.
Anyone attacking a guarded character must first make a standard combat roll against the guardian, and if that attack succeeds they deal no Damage, but have the option to make a second attack, as a \gls{quickaction}, against the guarded character.

If a guarded character moves, they lose the benefits of their guardian.

\paragraph{Moving}
\label{moving}
lets the character travel up to 3 steps plus their Athletics Skill.

\paragraph{Speaking}
requires 1~\gls{ap} if any player tells another to act, stop, or guard them.
During combat, everyone should focus on the task at hand, and communicate sparingly, only when they need to say something vital.

\subsection{\Glsfmtlongpl{fp}}
\label{fate_points}

The \glspl{pc} have a limited supply of luck -- often enough to prevent an injury, nearly always enough to hold back death.
This makes a lesson from the first tooth, axe, or claw, and maybe even the second.

\subsubsection{Narrative Flow}
comes naturally from battles where the \glspl{pc} have a near-miss, then take a permanent injury, but revive through returned courage.
\Glspl{fp} act just like `courage points' for \glspl{pc} (or even players) as a lot means battle, and none means `run'.
However, if they survive, their `courage' can return, despite remaining on 1~\gls{hp} for the remainder of the session.
\Pgls{pc} can go down to 1~\gls{fp}, then 2~\glspl{hp}, and \pgls{interval} later stand and persevere, as their luck returns.

Losing \glspl{fp} can mean any number of things.
\Pgls{pc} might stumble slip and catch themselves just in time, causing an arrow to narrowly miss their head; or the enemy might swing their sword and strike a stray tree-branch.
Injury is paid in \glspl{fp} while they last, then Damage starts to take large chunks from the \glspl{pc}.
This means \glspl{fp} work much like `courage points' -- characters fight with them, and leave when they run out.

\subsubsection{The Mechanic}
simply lets players spend \pgls{fp} instead of losing \pgls{hp}.
\Glspl{pc} can store a number of \glspl{fp} equal to their total \glspl{xp}, divided by 10, plus their Charisma Bonus.
$1D6$ return after \pgls{interval}.%
\footnote{See \autopageref{intervals} for \glspl{interval}.}

\begin{center}
  $$\Glspl{fp} = \frac{Total~\glsfmtplural{xp}}{10} + Charisma$$
\end{center}

\Glspl{npc} begin with none, but gain as many \glspl{fp} as the \glspl{pc} if they took part in a scene.%

\Glsentrylongpl{fp} never stop \glsentrylongpl{ep}.
Character who can survive a dozen archers through luck can still become exhausted, or poisoned.

\section{Equipment}

\begin{multicols}{2}

\subsection{Weapons}

\noindent
Weapons are a great way of inflicting additional Damage, and an equally excellent way of defending oneself.
Having a longsword to keep scary opponents at bay is always better than trying to nimbly dodge about.
Longer weapons grant an Attack Bonus, allowing someone to hit the enemy before the enemy hits them, and heavy weapons tend to deal more Damage.
However, both of these come at the cost of extra \emph{heft}; they take more time to swing, and so cost more \glspl{ap} to use.

Each weapon has the following properties:

\begin{itemize}

  \item
  \textbf{The Attack Bonus:} adds to the Attack roll, representing reach and manoeuvrability.
  \item
  \textbf{The Damage Bonus:} adds to the Damage of a successful Attack roll.
  This might represent sharpness in a dagger, or just sheer weight in the case of a war hammer.
  \item
  \textbf{The \Gls{ap} Cost:} shows how many \glspl{ap} the player spends after engaging in an Attack roll (whether attacking or being attacked).
  It represents a weapon's inertia (and hence difficulty in pulling it back from a swing), and allows enemies with lighter weapons to `close the gap'.
  \item
  \textbf{The \glsentryname{weight}:} means that your character must have at least double this number of \glspl{hp}, or they will struggle to use the weapon.
  %! update
\end{itemize}

\weaponsChart
\label{weaponschart}
\index{Weapons}

\subsubsection{Shields}
\index{Shields}
\label{shields}
are weapons.
The wide size means a big `Attack' Bonus, which works great for not being hit.
The wide size does not help with Damage, but \pgls{pc} might still manage to smack a woodspy in the eye with the edge on a lucky roll.

Having a shield and a weapon lets character choose which one to use for each attack.

\paragraph{Bucklers}
pair well with rapiers, but demand a full hand to hold -- the wielder must use the shield, not simply strap it to an arm.

\paragraph{Round Shields}
can strap onto an arm, which allows two free hands to direct a weapon.
They pair well with shortswords and mauls.

\paragraph{Kite Shields}
stand nearly as tall as the wielder.
They don't move as quickly, or easily as other shields, but still work well with a longsword or maul.

\shieldchart

\boxPair[t]{
  \subsubsection*{An Example}
  \gls{sunGuard} stands with a flail, and a cocky attitude.
  His basic Attack Score is 10, so rolling 10 means a tie.
  His full plate armour has \pgls{covering} of 5 and \gls{dr} 5.

  To hit him, \pgls{pc} will need to roll at $\tn[10] + 5 = 15$.

  Rolling 9 or less means the \gls{pc} is hit, unarmoured.

  \begin{boxtable}[cLc]
    \textbf{Roll} & \textbf{Result} & \textbf{Margin} \\
    \hline
       $\leq 9$ & \gls{pc} is hit, taking full Damage! & -1! \\
      10 & \emph{Draw} (\gls{dr} applies) & 0 \\
      11 & \Glsentrytext{npc} is hit, but \gls{dr} applies & \textbf{1} \\
      12 & \Glsentrytext{npc} is hit, but \gls{dr} applies & \textbf{2} \\
      13 & \Glsentrytext{npc} is hit, but \gls{dr} applies & \textbf{3} \\
      14 & \Glsentrytext{npc} is hit, but \gls{dr} applies & \textbf{4} \\
      $\geq 15$ & \emph{\Gls{vitalShot}!} -- full Damage to \gls{npc} & \textit{5!} \\
  \end{boxtable}

  You might think of each potential number you can roll as a location on the body, with armour adding \gls{covering} to certain numbers.
  In this case, the \gls{pc} rolls a 15, so he hits for 6 Damage, and the knight loses 6~\glspl{hp}.

\subsection{Armour}
\index{Armour}

When armour works, its \glsentryfullpl{dr} reduces incoming Damage.
It applies before \glspl{fp}, so \gls{dr} and \glspl{fp} make a powerful and steady combination.

\subsubsection{\Glsfmtplural{vitalShot}}
\label{vitals}
work when armour doesn't.
Chain strips fixed with leather straps won't cover everything, so when you roll high enough to exceed your opponent's \gls{covering} you hit them between the armoured bits.
And likewise, if you miss an Attack roll by more than your armour's \gls{covering}, the \gls{dr} does nothing.

We call this `\pgls{vitalShot}', because it's vital to make it happen, but not to let it happen.

Creatures with a naturally tough hide (or chitin, or carapace) usually have \pgls{covering} of 5, but the same principle applies.
If you hit 5 over the Attack target, you can bust an eye, spinneret, mandible, or some other unidentifiable part.
Anything squishy makes a good target.

\armourchart

\subsubsection{Armour Types}

\paragraph{Padded}
pieces of fabric on top of other fabric, and eventually, you can slow down a blade a little.
Of course it stinks, and weighs a tonne, so best leave it until the most desperate of times.

\ifnum\value{r4}=3
  \paragraph{Elvish Ceramic}
  has very little strength on a piece-by-piece basic, but once worn in the correct arrangement, it gains surprising strength, and makes a pleasant `clinking' sound.
  It also sells well to human nobles who want to armour their children for long road trips. 
\fi

\paragraph{Leather}
armour is made by boiling leather for a long time, until it becomes extremely tough.
While anyone can pick up leather cheaply, few have the skill to make this armour.

\paragraph{Chain mail}
is a covering of chain links, placed over some other protection.
It might be placed over hardened leather, or just some thick padding.
The chain itself only protects against a weapon's blade, not the weight, while the under-layer protects against heavy weapons, such as hammers or mauls.

\paragraph{Plate armour}
involves adding all of the above into one armour, with sheets of metal on top.
Allowing someone to move within this pile of metal requires rare artisans.


\paragraph{Natural Armour}
means tough skin (or scales, or chitin\ldots) thick enough to push back blades.
Natural armour always has \pgls{covering} of 4 unless otherwise specified, because it covers almost all of the body, but still leaves weak spots open such as the eyes or the kneecaps.

\subsubsection{Banding \Glsfmttext{dr}}
\label{bandingArmour}
together won't work by just layering lots of armour, so the \glspl{pc} cannot usually attempt Banding with \gls{dr}.
But undead creatures have \pgls{dr} to represent their complete corporeal apathy; this could combine with armour's \gls{dr} for even less corporeal concerns.

As with any other Banding action,%
\footnote{See \autopageref{banding}.}
the highest \gls{dr} applies, then the second.
So a ghast with chain armour (\gls{dr}~5) and their undead resistance (\gls{dr}~2), gains a total \gls{dr} of 6.

Stacked armour can consist of different levels of \gls{covering}, meaning a roll could bypass one set of armour by rolling 3 over the creature's \gls{tn}, while another type of armour (with \pgls{covering} of 4) still applies.

Consider this convoluted example: a basilisk with its natural \gls{dr} of 4 dies, and then an over-curious \gls{seeker} raises it from the dead.
The undead naturally have a \gls{dr} of 2, so this secondary source of damage would count for half, giving it a total \gls{dr} of 5.
If the \gls{seeker} fashioned plate armour to the basilisk, the total \gls{dr} would be\ldots

\begin{center}
{
  \LARGE $5 + $\Large$4\frac{1}{2} + $\normalsize$2\frac{1}{4} =  7.5$
}
\end{center}

\ldots or `8' (after rounding up).

If the plate armour had \pgls{covering} of only 3 then rolling 3 over the creature's \gls{tn} would leave it with a \gls{dr} of only 5.

\end{multicols}

Projectiles have their own Martial Skill, which covers everything from javelins to bows.

}
A successful evasion allows someone to move -- usually behind cover, or towards the archer.
However, unlike toe-to-toe combat, those on the receiving end cannot reflexively dodge; they must have at least 1~\gls{ap} to spend in order to resist with their \roll{Speed}{Vigilance}.

Just as with weapon combat, a high enough roll can be a \gls{vitalShot},%
\footnote{See \autopageref{vitals}.}
ignoring all \gls{dr}.

All projectiles suffer from the need to reload.
As with picking up any other item, characters must spend least 1~\gls{ap} to take out and use arrows.

\subsubsection{The Long Bow}
\index{Projectiles!Bow}
\index{Bows}
\label{longbow}

Long bows (or `hunting bows') are difficult things to work but well worth it once the archer practices enough.
To use a bow, the archer must have a Strength Bonus at least as high as the bow's Damage.
So if a hunting bow deals $1D6+2$ Damage, the archer will need at least a Strength of +2 to draw the arrow properly (or at all).
Having a Strength of 3 will not increase the Damage, but it can decrease the firing time.

To pull back the heavy load on a long bow requires 2~\glspl{ap}, plus the bow's Damage bonus, so a bow which deals +3 Damage requires 5~\glspl{ap} to fire.%
\footnote{
  This may seem harsh, but bows really are harsh.  Archers pointing their bow downwards and drawing an arrow back must pull a weight similar to lifting a human by their foot.
}

Long bows can be fired for hundreds of yards -- the maximum range is generally more determined by the archer's ability to aim rather than the bow.

\subsubsection{The Short Bow}
\index{Projectiles!Short Bow}
\index{Short Bow}
or `trick bow', is a smaller, lighter thing which can be used by anyone.
What it lacks in punch it makes up for in quick draw time.
As usual, for every five steps beyond the first two the archer suffers a -1 penalty to hit.
A short bow takes \pgls{ap} to reload, and \pgls{ap} to fire an arrow, so archers can loose an arrow or two each round.

Shortbows have a maximum range of 20 steps, and deal $1D6-1$ Damage.
They often bring down prey with multiple arrows rather than a single, deep-penetrating arrow.

\subsubsection{The Crossbow}
\index{Projectiles!Crossbow}
\label{crossbow}
can pierce plate armour, but cannot be reloaded without a thirty-minute lecture about leverage and torque.
They have a standard Damage of $2D6$, though different crossbows vary in quality.
Crossbows requires only 1~\gls{ap} to fire, but require 5 rounds, minus the user's Strength Bonus, to reload.
Reloading always takes a minimum of 1 round.

\subsubsection{Thrown Weapons}
\index{Projectiles!Thrown Weapons}
such as knives, spears or others are typically not great at killing enemies, but they can certainly wound them.
They work just as short bows, but their Damage is the normal weapon Damage minus 2.

\index{Projectiles!Impromptu}
are available only to the very rich, as sensible people don't throw swords, axes, knives, or cups away.
But if a player insists on exotic financial ballistics, they can inflict cuts, bruises, and very bad headaches on enemies, as they receive a -2 penalty to hit for every 5 steps distance from the target, and a -2 penalty to Damage.

\section{Complications}

\begin{multicols}{2}

\subsection{Circumstances}

These rules cover things that happen to characters.
You can refer back to them when necessary with the list in \autoref{combatAppendix}.

\makeAutoRule{blindness}{Blindness}{spend 1~\glsentrytext{ap} and make a \roll{Wits}{Vigilance} before any other action}
\index{Combat!Blindness}
in a battle requires responding to all attacks by spending \pgls{ap} and rolling \roll{Wits}{Vigilance}.
Failure you receive Damage, but success achieves nothing.
The same applies to initiating an attack, or moving anywhere.
Loud noises (such as battle-cries) can easily increase this \gls{tn} to 12.

While fighting blind, if the dice make \pgls{natural} roll equal to the number of nearby people on the character's side (including themself) then they hit a companion accidentally.
So if a troupe of 5 people become blinded, each of them would hit a companion on the \gls{natural} of 5 or less, if they tried to attack anything, whether as a response or not.

\makeAutoRule{darkness}{Darkness}{maximum Bonus equals \roll{Wits}{Vigilance}}
\label{darkness}
\index{Darkness}
\index{Combat!Darkness}
\index{Caving!Fighting in darkness}
or deep twilight, can give a distinct advantage to those with sharper senses.
However, when both sides suffer from the darkness, the battle changes very little.
Neither side can hit accurately, but then neither side can dodge or parry well either.

\paragraph*{When fighting in total darkness}
characters Attribute bonuses cannot go beyond the character's \roll{Wits}{Vigilance}.

\begin{exampletext}
  For example, a human guard has caught a room full of elves with stolen goods.
  Thinking quickly, one of the elves douses the room's only lantern.
  The human has a Wits Bonus of -1 and no Vigilance Skill, so his maximum roll has a -1 penalty.
  The elves have a total \roll{Wits}{Vigilance} of +3, so their \roll{Dexterity}{Combat} has only a +3 cap.
\end{exampletext}

\paragraph{Fighting in minimal light}
(such as a moonless night)
only gives a -1 penalty to characters with a \roll{Wits}{Vigilance} lower than their roll.

\makeAutoRule{enclosedcombat}{Enclosed Spaces}{penalty equals weapon's Attack Bonus}
\index{Caving!Enclosed Combat}
cause serious problems for people wielding longswords, battle axes, and other large weapons.
Daggers and shortswords often have an easier time in these locations.

When a character has no space to swing a weapon -- either vertically or horizontally -- their Attack gains a penalty equal to the weapon's Attack Bonus.

\makeAutoRule{holdingBreath}{Holding the Breath}{+1~\glsentrytext{ep} per round, must breath in at -1~\glsentrytext{ap}}
\index{Combat!Staying Silent}
during combat allows one to stay silent, and not breath any nasty gasses in.
While doing so, the character gains 1~\gls{ep} each round (these \glspl{ep} are tracked separately, and vanish soon after combat).

If the character every falls below 0~\glspl{ap}, then their stamina and focus has run out, and they breathe in immediately.

\makeAutoRule{higherGround}{The Higher Ground}{+1 Bonus}
means gravity helps on the down-swing, while the opponent must bring their head a little bit closer, while moving one precious head further back.

\makeAutoRule{entangled}{Trapped, Entangled, or Prone}{-2~\glsentrytext{ap} Penalty}
\label{trapped}
\index{Combat!Prone}
\index{Combat!Entangled}
\label{prone}
characters may be caught in mud, shackled to a pillar, or caught in a web.
They take a penalty to Speed (the default is -2), which reduces their \glspl{ap}.

\subsection{Manoeuvres}

These additional actions cover different ways to engage with enemies.
Anyone can use them at any point, if they use the right weapons.

\makeAutoRule{closeMagic}{Close Magic}{roll vs enemy's Attack as usual}
\index{Combat!Magic}
\index{Magic!Close}
\index{Spells!Combat}
happens when someone tries to stab a witch.
The works like any other Resisted Action -- if she rolls higher, he spell works, but if the opponent rolls higher, she receives Damage.

Of course, one must use a spell which could plausibly impede the attack.
Summoning a small cyclone in someone's face, or cursing their sword-arm with bad luck could both repel and attack, but a spell to make someone forget that it is Tuesday would not.

Spells retain their original \gls{tn} when used up close, so people can resist Mind spells with their \roll{Wits}{Academics} at the same time as \roll{Dexterity}{Brawl}.
If the witch beats the former \gls{tn} but not the latter, she might confused someone just enough to avoid attack, but not enough for a successful Mind spell.

But if the \roll{Dexterity}{Brawl} resistance succeeds, the witch's spell automatically fails, as she her focus collapses.
In this case, no \glspl{mp} are spent.

\makeAutoRule{drawWeapon}{Drawing a Weapon}{spend 1~\glsentrytext{ap}}
from a scabbard simply costs \pgls{ap}.
Drawing a weapon from a \textit{rucksack}, however, could cost a couple of rounds.

\makeAutoRule{dropWeapon}{Dropping a Weapon}{free}
Dropping a weapon costs no \glspl{ap}, though they will be defenceless unless they do this while picking up another weapon.

\pic{Roch_Hercka/stances}

\makeAutoRule{flank}{Flanking}{+2 Attack Bonus}
grants a +2 Attack Bonus.
Up to 6 opponents can attack a lone character, but only half can flank, and any available walls reduce this number.

\makeAutoRule{grab}{Grabbing}{attack with Brawl, both become Entangled}
\index{Combat!Grappling}
someone uses no weapons, and leaves both parties \textit{Entangled}.

Some animals, with \textit{Teeth}, can grab and deal Damage, but most humanoids need to grab first, and \emph{then} deal Damage with a grapple.

\makeAutoRule{grapple}{Grappling}{Resisted \roll{Strength}{Brawl} roll to deal Damage}
\label{grappling}
with an opponent might consist in bites, headbutts, twisted bones, or strangulation-by-tentacle.
However it goes, no weapons can be used while grappling if they have \pgls{weight} above 1.

\makeAutoRule{guarding}{Guarding}{redirect attacks against one person to yourself. Cost: 1~\glsentrytext{ap}}
\index{Guarding}
someone just requires standing in front of them.
All attacks redirect to you after that point.
This includes missile attacks only if you could otherwise evade them.

If someone else tries to attack your charge, you will have to move to protect them, with a normal movement action.

\makeAutoRule{ram}{Ramming}{Force an enemy back with \roll{Strength}{Brawl}: 2~\glspl{ap}}
\index{Combat!Ram}
into someone with a should or shield can push them back half your standard movement.
You spend 1~\gls{ap} for the movement, and another for the push.
The standard Weapon Bonus from any shield gives a Bonus to this roll (\autopageref{shields}).

If the opponent resists with \roll{Strength}{Brawl} (and possibly a shield), then success allows you to push them back as you advanced.

If they try jump out of the way with \roll{Speed}{Athletics}, then failure implies that they fall \textit{Prone}.

\makeAutoRule{sneakattack}{Sneak Attacks}{\roll{Dexterity}{Stealth}, roll Damage at +2}
\label{sneakattack}
\index{Combat!Sneak Attack}
aren't generally possible during a fight.
Elsewhere, they might use Dexterity, Intelligence, or something else.

Heavy weapons do not help much with surprise attacks, as one needs to swing them up into position.
Any weapon with a \gls{weight} higher than 1 adds its \gls{weight} to the \gls{tn}.

If successful, the sneak attack deals +2 Damage, and provides an automatic \gls{vitalShot}.

\section{Chases}
\index{Chases}
\label{chases}

\chasechart

\begin{multicols}{2}

\subsection{Fleeing}

Running from a fight means a character rolls \roll{Speed}{Athletics} against the opponent's usual \gls{tn}, usually their \roll{Dexterity}{Combat}.
On success, the character starts to flee, and on failure, the character receives Damage.
A tie always implies both.

Once a chase has begun, both sides make a Resisted Roll of \roll{Speed}{Athletics}.
A success Margin of 3 means the characters flee far and fast enough to escape their pursuers, but gain \pgls{ep} for the distance run.

\subsubsection{Switching Traits}

Any smaller success Margin means the characters do not escape their pursuers, but can determine where the direction of the chase, leading their pursuers exactly where they want, changing the nature of the chase with a newfound \gls{area}.
Changing \pgls{area} can change the Traits involved, so the characters can decide to hide, replacing \roll{Dexterity}{Athletics} with \roll{Dexterity}{Stealth}.
Or they might head straight into \pgls{area} of harsh bushes which demand strong limbs to move aside; this changes the roll to \roll{Strength}{Athletics}.

Players can only select a Trait which makes sense in the current context.
\Pgls{pc} might use \roll{Speed}{Empathy} when hurriedly asking a farmer to hide them, but they can't use Academics just because they're in a library.

Whenever the troupe run together, each has an individual roll, so the troupe can either accept the result of the character with the lowest roll, or split up.
The same applies when switching Traits -- one character may climb up a challenging wall (switching the roll to \roll{Dexterity}{Athletics}), while another ducks behind a wide tree (switching the roll to \roll{Speed}{Stealth}).

\subsubsection{Failure}
A small Failure Margin works the same way, but in reverse.
A single Failure Margin means the pursuers chase the troupe through 2~\glspl{area}, herding them right where they want them, and switching to another Trait.

A Failure Margin of 3 or more means the pursuers chase the characters through \pgls{area} before catching them.

\subsection{Hunting}

Running after prey follows exactly the same rules, but in reverse.
The players roll so the \glspl{pc} can catch their prey.
As per the previous chart, a near-failure can be worse than a total failure.

\section{Further Dangers}

\begin{multicols}{2}

\makeAutoRule{falling}{Falling Damage}{falling Damage equals half the \glsfmtplural{step} fallen, plus the characters Strength.}
\index{Falling}
Falling Damage equals half the \glspl{step} fallen, plus the characters Strength.
The Damage then converts to a dice roll instead.

If the \glspl{pc} all fall off a building, 3~\glspl{step} high, they would start with 2~Damage.
Smaller creatures have less body to fall, so a gnome, with Strength~-2 would take no Damage from this fall; while a dwarf with Strength~+0 would take 2 Damage (which converts to \dmg{2}).
Larger creatures feel their own weight crushing down on them, so a gnoll with Strength~+4 would suffer 6~Damage (which converts to \dmg{6}).

Characters who fell in a downward-arc can attempt to break their fall with a roll (in both senses), and avoid all Damage, with \roll{Speed}{Athletics}.
The \gls{tn} is 7 plus the height of the fall.
However, when falling straight downwards, the \gls{tn} is 7 plus \textit{double} the height in \glspl{step}.

\begin{boxtable}[cYXX]
  \textbf{Strength} & \textbf{Height} & \textbf{Damage} & \textbf{TN} \\
  \hline
  \calcFallingDamage{-2}{6}
  \calcFallingDamage{0}{3}
  \calcFallingDamage{0}{6}
  \calcFallingDamage{3}{1}
  \calcFallingDamage{3}{3}
  \calcFallingDamage{3}{6}
\end{boxtable}

\subsection{Animals}

\subsubsection{Claws}
\label{claws}
inflict +1 Damage during Brawl-based attacks.

\subsubsection{Fangs}
\label{teeth}
\label{fangs}
allow animals to grapple and damage with the same attack.
So when an attack is successful, the target both receives Damage and counts as \textit{grappled}.%
\footnote{Find them \vpageref{grappling}.}

\subsubsection{Flight}
demands delicate proportions.
The sheer size of the wings mean their \gls{weight} equals half the creature's \glspl{hp}.


\begin{itemize}
  \item
  Creatures with a higher \gls{weight} than their own Speed Bonus cannot fly from the ground -- they must climb something high, and take off from a jump.
  \item
  Creatures with \pgls{weight} equal to their Speed Bonus can fly after sprinting for a full round.
  \item
  Finally, those with \pgls{weight} below their Speed Bonus can simply jump into flight, from the ground.
\end{itemize}

Creatures with the Air Sphere can spend \pgls{mp} to add their Air Sphere to Speed for the purposes of taking off.

Creatures with any amount of encumbrance cannot take off.

\makeAutoRule{swarms}{Swarms}{each \glsfmttext{hp} occupies one \glsfmttext{step}, which inflicts 1~\glsfmttext{hp} Damage per round. Swarms take up to 1~Damage per attack}
\index{Swarms}

This abstract spread of \glspl{hp} can represent a swarm of feral rats, a buzzing hive of blood-draining stirges, or any other tiny thing which can act as a unit.
We can't track individual bites and stings -- instead the swarm moves as one, but dies separately.

Swarms ignore Partial armour covering (as they can wriggle across the uncovered parts), but cannot attack anyone in Complete armour at all, unless they achieve a \gls{vitalShot}.
