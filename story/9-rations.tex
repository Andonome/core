\begin{exampletext}
	Out in the forest, the group need some fire starting equipment.
	Luckily, Arneson's player put down three pieces of \gls{adventuringequipment}, which could be any number of things.
	He marks one off, and decides this particular piece of \gls{adventuringequipment} is a tinder box, so he can start a fire.

	Meanwhile, Hugi is out of rations, so his player marks his last piece of \gls{adventuringequipment} as a day's rations.
