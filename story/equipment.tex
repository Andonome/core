    Sean now only needs his starting equipment.
    We covered already that he starts with any two items worth 10 \gls{sp} or less plus one more item per Skill.
    The Combat Skill, Empathy and Performance let him start with 3 items in total.
    We'll start with some shiny Partial chainmail and a longsword so he can fight.
    His final item will be \gls{adventuringequipment}, so he'll have some flexibility for later.

  Rolling $3D6-5$ for his starting money, I've got a `9', so I'm starting with ($9\times 2^3$) 72\glspl{cp}.
