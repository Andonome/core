		Sean now only needs his starting equipment.
		We covered already that he starts with any two items worth 10 \gls{sp} or less plus one more item per Skill.
		The Combat Skill, Empathy and Performance let him start with 3 items in total.
		We'll start with some shiny Partial chainmail and a longsword so he can fight.
		His final item will be \gls{adventuringequipment}, so he'll have some flexibility for later.

		Rolling $3D6$ for his starting money, I've got a `9', so I'm starting with 4 ($9-5=4$).
		His three specialized skills double that number, making it 32 ($4\times2^3$).
		Since one of those Skills is Academics, he'll start with 32 \glspl{sp} rather than \glspl{cp}.
