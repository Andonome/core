When they arrive at the town of Arano, they see the mountain their bard was supposedly wandering over in the distance.
The mountain stands peacefully, but Arano looks in complete disarray.
People nip back and forth with cartloads of breads and smoked meats while others rush past with no discernible purpose.

Sean needs information on whether or not that bard has travelled through here, how long ago and whether anyone noticed anything strange about his book, or singing.
He has no desire to wait until things calm down of their own accord -- he needs to leave today.

Sean's player uses his Intelligence Bonus (0) and Empathy \gls{skill} (+1).
The \gls{gm} doesn't say a \gls{tn} so the \gls{tn} is 7.
Sean's player rolls $2D6+1$ and the dice show a 4 and a 1, for a grand total of 6.
The roll is a failure.

After stopping several people they frantically explained that hobgoblins have attacked the last village before the South mountains -- Casarenna.
The strange man-devouring monsters have been pushed back but the village must still be in need of military aid.
Apparently the mountains are full of hobgoblins, waiting to come down and eat everything.

Sean suddenly regretted his views on that two hundred gold coin reward.
He was almost certain his companions would turn back, but his dwarvish companion, Hugi, surprised him.

  \begin{quotation}
  Laddie, listen.
  Them dwarves in that there mountain hae a pact wi' a village o' yonder side o' the mountains.
  They telt them that if ever there was worry, they'd protect them.
  As a result the village hae always gi'en em aw're best meats fer cheap.
  An wan o' them just happens tae be ma cousin.
  A'm afraid Ah'm honour bound tae gang over the mountain and warn the village on the other side o' the coming storm, e`en if every last guid dwarf dwellin' thar be deed.
  \end{quotation}

Sean thought for a moment.
If Hugi was at all upset by all the other dwarves in the mountain being killed by hobgoblins, his cousin presumably included, he didn't show it.
Still, it was important to warn anyone who didn't know.
An unexpected hobgoblin attack could spread like wildfire before being put down, at least if people are not prepared.

Arneson nodded too.
The three were in agreement.
They would go across the mountains, capture their bard in the South Kingdom and then warn those people about the hobgoblins in the mountains.
But first Sean would still have to get the villagers to tell him about the bard, and where he went.
