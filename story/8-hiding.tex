  While previously the players rolled to hide against their opponent's ability to spot them, this time they roll to see if they spot a hidden opponent.
  The character with the highest score is Arneson, with Wits 0 and Vigilance +1.
  The \gls{gm} decides that the hobgoblin should use his Speed Bonus of +1, and his Stealth Skill adds +1 again.
  The hobgoblins' score of +2 adds to the basic \gls{tn} of 7, producing a final \gls{tn} of 9.
  Arneson's player rolls $2D6$ to produce a final score of `12' -- the roll is a success and the margin is 3.
  Since the margin is quite good, the \gls{gm} decides that the troop leave the area before they are engaged and gain a +3 bonus to running away.

  The thatched roof on the nearby cottage rustles and Arneson instinctively draws his companions back.
  They turn and run before their adversary can make his leap down to meet them with his axe.
  They enter the safety of the darkness surrounding Casarenna but the hobgoblins stampede fast behind them with guttural cries and war songs about dinner.

  A scurrying of agile, hungry feet fill the little muddy rows between houses.
  The trio looked about for an escape route.
  Unknown to them, one of the hobgoblins was meant to be keeping a lookout from the roof of the cottage on the edge of town.
  He observes them for a brief moment and then jumps off, axe in hand, ready to make up for all the meals he missed while pretending to keep guard.
  They run into the dark until their shins feel ready to bleed.
  Eventually, the pain is worse than the fear of death.
  Hugi and Sean try to regain their own breath while Arneson goes to gather branches for a temporary shelter.
  Despite their distance from the village, the wind carries reverberating songs so them throughout the night.
