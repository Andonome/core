\section{Activities}

\begin{multicols}{2}

\togglefalse{examplecharacter}

\subsection{Breaking Things}

\makeRule{break_door}{Breaking in a door}{Strength}{Crafts}{10}
A tie could indicate that the door has a massive hole in the middle, allowing a sufficiently small person to squeeze through; or it might indicate that the door caves in after multiple, noisy strikes.

\subsection{Downtime Activities}

\makeRule{poison}{Brewing a poison}{Intelligence}{Medicine}{4}
\index{Poisons}

Basic poisons inflict 2 \glspl{ep} over the course of \pgls{interval}, then stop.
People can notice a poison by smell or taste before they drink it, by rolling \roll{Wits}{Vigilance} (\tn[7]).
Poisons lose their potence over time -- the \gls{ep} loss suffered reduces by to half of what it was each week.

The standard roll begins at \tn[7].
The caster can add any of the following boons to the poison.
However, each boon increases the \gls{tn} by 1.

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  Inflict 1 more \gls{ep} on the target over \pgls{interval}.
  \item
  Increase the number of \glspl{interval} the poison will work for.
  \item
  Increase the \gls{tn} to notice the poison.
  \item
  Increase the shelf-life of the poison by a week.
\end{itemize}

A poison might inflict 4 \glspl{ep} each \gls{interval}, for 3 \glspl{interval}, and require a \roll{Wits}{Vigilance} roll at \tn[10] but this would raise the \gls{tn} from 7 to 14.

\makeRule{sword_crafting}{Crafting a sword}{Strength}{Crafts}{13}

This requires equipment, such as moulds, and a long night.
It also requires a single level of the Combat Skill.

A tie could indicate a completed sword, with a shattered mould.

\makeRule{make_mould}{Creating a weapon mould}{Intelligence}{Crafts}{10}
Anything with a cost of less than 10 \gls{cp} can be fashioned in less than a day, with only basic woodworking tools.

\makeRule{make_armour}{Creating silent plate armour}{Intelligence}{Crafts}{16}
Creating silent plate requires planning from the outset -- existing armour cannot be properly modified.
The parts cost an additional 50\%, and the crafter must have both the Combat and Stealth Skills at level 1.

Every margin on the roll reduces the armour's penalty by 1, to a minimum of -1.

\makeRule{make_song}{Composing a new song}{Intelligence}{Performance}{10}
This won't let the character perform the song -- just compose, and possibly explain it.

\makeRule{tame_horse}{Taming a Horse}{Intelligence}{Wyldcrafting}{depends on Horse's \roll{Wits}{Brawl}}

\subsection{News \& Information}

\makeRule{find_rumours}{Finding rumours}{Charisma}{Empathy}{3}
See also, verifying rumours, \vpageref{verify_rumours}.

\makeRule{identify_talisman}{Identifying a \glsfmttext{talisman}}{Intelligence}{Academics}{12, then 14}
Magical items do not darken people's doors often, but once they do, you had best get some educated advice.
The initial roll tells someone how to activate \pgls{talisman}, and which Spheres created it (ties only tell the Spheres).
A second roll, at \tn[14], is required to know what the \gls{talisman} does (ties indicate something about what it does), but not the full picture.

%\subsection{Schemes \& Plots}

\makeRule{find_hidden_message}{Finding a hidden message in a book}{Intelligence}{Vigilance}{7}
The message-hider can set any \gls{tn} they please.

\makeRule{letter_sealing}{Letter sealing}{Dexterity}{Academics}{9}
Proper seals have more than a blob of wax to keep them safe.
Ultra secret letters have parts of the paper cut, then pierce the middle, and loop back around the outside.
While anyone can open these letters, opening them without breaking the seal (so the letter does not appear to have been read) is nearly impossible.
Failure indicates that the letter's seal breaks moments later, as the paper has been cut too thin.
A tie indicates nothing special -- but of course opening the letter won't be quite the challenge it could be.

Opening such a letter and resealing it properly requires an \roll{Intelligence}{Academics} roll, at \tn[14], plus the margin of whoever sealed the letter originally.

\makeRule{verify_rumours}{Verifying rumours}{Intelligence}{Empathy}{13}
This usually takes a long time, and is best suited to \gls{downtime}.

\subsection{Survival}

\makeRule{black_walking}{Black-Walking}{Dexterity}{Caving}{8}
Despite every caver insisting on a good supply of torches and candles, they all end up feeling the ground in the dark eventually.
Those who know their environment have a knack for crawling efficiently, feeling the surroundings through their fingertips and beards, and remembering every passage they took in the light simply through the sounds of their own breathing echoing uniquely in every cavern-segment.
\index{Black Walking}
\index{Spelunking!Black Walking}

\makeRule{build_shelter}{Building a shelter}{Intelligence}{Wyldcrafting}{11}
Each point on the Margin allows an additional person to sleep inside the shelter.
A tie indicates that the shelter holds for \pgls{interval}, then collapses.

\makeRule{cure_poison}{Curing a poison}{Wits}{Medicine}{10, each margin cures 1 \glsfmttext{ep}}
Each Margin cures 1 \glspl{ep} caused by poison by the end of the \gls{interval}.
Of course if the roll fails, each Failure Margin \emph{inflicts} \pgls{ep}.

\makeRule{hypoxia}{Hypoxia}{Intelligence}{Caving}{10 to notice problem, gain \glsfmtlongpl{ep} on failure}
Long, underground tunnels don't have a lot of oxygen.
Taking a torch down one, or even staying down too long, and sucking up all the oxygen, can cause hypoxia.
\index{Hypoxia}
\index{Spelunking!Hypoxia}

Once hypoxia begins, people will feel light headed, confused, and dizzy.
If any \gls{pc} succeeds in the roll, they understand that hypoxia has settled in, and can put out their torches in order to stop the penalty increasing too quickly, and will probably try to move elsewhere.

If the \glspl{pc} fail the roll, the \gls{gm} should increase the \gls{tn} for all rolls, without explaining why the \gls{tn} for most actions have risen, and continue increasing the \gls{tn} until the party find themselves weak, and confused, or manage to get out the other side.

Once out, all penalties vanish, except for a single \gls{ep}.

\makeRule{whittling}{Whittling Wood}{Dexterity}{Crafts}{10}
Characters can fashion anything with a cost of less than 10 \gls{cp} in less than a day, with only basic woodworking tools.

\subsection{Town Activities}

\makeRule{hookey}{Walking Through Town}{Wits}{Empathy}{depends on area, bonus for rank}
The \gls{guard} should guard against the forest, not hide (nor drink) in towns.

Of course people make exceptions for higher-ranking \gls{guard}, and plenty of the guard manage to sneak into town regularly.

\Gls{guard} characters can add any rank they have earned to any rolls.
`Fodder' add nothing, while `Diggers' can add +1 to the roll.

\sidebox[17]{
  \begin{boxtable}

    \textbf{\gls{tn}} & \textbf{Location} \\\hline

    5 & Friend's Home \\

    6 & \gls{healersGuild} \\

    8 & Slums \\

    9 & Tavern \\

    9 & Rich Neighbourhood \\

    10 & Market \\

    12 & \gls{sunGuard} Station \\

  \end{boxtable}
}

Entering a town requires an \roll{Intelligence}{Larceny} group roll (\tn[7]).
\Glspl{guard} who cannot find alternative clothing to their standard, dark, uniforms, take a -4 penalty to this roll.

A tie indicates the character has been caught, and should leave (but suffers no punishment).
Remaining in town requires a \roll{Wits}{Empathy} roll to go undetected.
Rolling over the \gls{tn} by 1 allows an extra day, then 2 days, then 4, 8, and so on.

\paragraph{Getting caught}
demands an immediate \roll{Wits}{Deceit} roll (\tn[10]).
Failure means a trip to the \gls{court}.
Characters who flee will find their name known across the land, especially to the \gls{sunGuard}, and will find the \gls{warden} taking the failure to appear in their \gls{court} a personal insult.

\makeRule{buyService}{Judging services}{Wits}{Empathy}{9}
It's never easy knowing whom to hire.
Every time someone hires someone as part of a service, they should make a roll.

Humans are notoriously bad at this, and are known for hiring the first person they meet in a bar.

Failing the roll means that the \gls{pc} has hired someone useless.
Perhaps they want to work with you because they have no idea how bad they are at their job, or perhaps they simply want to rip you off by taking a guess at the best route and hoping for the best.
The Failure Margin should indicate just how bad the henchman is, so the \gls{gm} is encouraged to make the roll in secret.

A tie generally indicates noticing a serious problem with purchased services\ldots just after the purchase completes.

\index{Bards}
Given the stakes, people try to hire others based on previous experience.
Others hope for a nearby bard of some kind -- not just any old minstrel, but someone who has a solid grasp on the reputation of everyone around, from multiple sources, and keeps up to date with all local markets of any size.
The successes and failures of everyone in a marketplace -- from the over-ripe tomatoes they sold, to the sword-smith who makes exceptionally reliable blades -- often become the contents of songs; so anyone listening to a nearby bard can gain a Bonus to their ability to discern reliable services from useless ones.

No Skill could cover this ability.
The bard simply has to exchange gossip at the markets for some months.

\makeRule{pick_pocket}{Picking a pocket}{Dexterity}{Larceny}{12}
Stealing in larger, more populated areas, affords more opportunities, while small \glspl{village}, where everyone is aware of everyone in their personal space, and rarely carry larger sums of money, raises the \gls{tn} significantly.

\index{Pickpocketing}

A tie means the character gets the item, but the victim immediately notices the crime.

\larcenyChart

\makeRule{request_danger_job}{Requesting dangerous jobs}{Charisma}{Empathy}{depends on location}
Thieves, brigands, and illegal adventurers cannot work with just anyone who wanders up to ask for `one poison arrow, my good man'.
Dangerous jobs require a level of trust.
Charismatic characters who show care and tact stand a much better chance of hiring help.

\sidebox{
  \begin{boxtable}[lY]

    \textbf{Location} & \textbf{Base} \textbf{\glsentrytext{tn}} \\\hline

    City & 9 \\

    Town & 11 \\

    \Gls{village} & 14 \\

  \end{boxtable}
}

Any attempt to hire services which put someone in danger should require a roll.
This includes murder, crafting poisons, selling illegal items, et c.

Working well with someone means that someone can gain a good local reputation (perhaps just among mercenaries, dodgy apothecaries, or librarians), while returning from a job with a missing man means a mark on the \gls{pc}'s reputation.

\subsection{Travel}

\makeRule{area_knowledge}{Area knowledge}{Intelligence}{Academics}{set by area}
Cities are \tn[7], Towns are 9, and \glspl{village} are 13.
A successful roll indicates a working knowledge of the place.

\makeRule{ford_river}{Fording a rapid river}{Strength}{Seafaring}{9}
Success gets you to the other side, and failure gets you washed downstream.
A tie gets you a bit of both.

\makeRule{gather_food}{Gathering Food}{Wits}{Wyldcrafting}{set by area}

Groups can forage while on the road, but taking a resting action requires devoting \pgls{interval} to focussing on foraging (see \autopageref{intervals}).
Of course, these fast excursions from the path, to check out anything that happens to catch their eye, can lead to quick decisions, or even to encounters with wandering beasts.
\index{Gathering Food}\index{Food}

\gatheringChart

\makeRule{keep_watch}{Keeping watch over night}{Strength}{Vigilance}{7.  3 \glsfmtlongpl{ep} between watchers}
Success inflicts 3 \glspl{ep} on those staying up at night.
They may divide these \glspl{ep} in any way, so one person could keep watch all night and gain all 3, or the first watcher might gain 2~\glspl{ep}, and the second only 1.%
\footnote{\Glspl{gm} NB: you should take out three coins, each representing \pgls{ep}, and have the players take them.}

\makeRule{climbing}{Climbing}{Speed}{Athletics}{varies greatly}

Rolling a tie indicates that the climber knows they cannot make the climb, or at least fails on the first few holds.
Failure with a Margin of 1 gives the worst possible result -- the climber fails while near the top, while a larger failure Margin means they travelled less far before falling.

\makeRule{detect_sloping}{Detect sloping passages}{Wits}{Caving}{10}
Understanding what altitude one has reached immediately indicates whether there might be running water, what type of rocks and minerals compose the surroundings (and therefore the chance of a cave-in), and how far one has to go to the surface.

\index{Spelunking!Detecting sloping passages}
Despite gradual gradients, or sharp ups and downs, a good caver knows exactly how far they sit from the surface at all times.

Rolling a tie might indicate knowing that one has descended or ascended, but with no idea how much.

\makeRule{detect_cavein}{Detecting tunnel weaknesses}{Intelligence}{Caving}{9}
Nobody survives long underground unless they can tell if the ceiling might collapse from heavy footfall.
\index{Spelunking!Note weak tunnel}

\makeRule{mend_sail}{Mending a sail}{Dexterity}{Seafaring}{10}

\makeAutoRule{march}{Marching}{gain 1~\glsfmtlongpl{ep} each mile of rough terrain, and 1~\glsfmtlongpl{ep} for every 2~miles of road, each \glsfmttext{interval}}
\index{Walking}
\index{Marching}
\index{Travel}
Marching characters gain 1~\glspl{ep} each mile of rough terrain, and 1~\glsfmtlongpl{ep} for every 2~miles of road, each \gls{interval}.
If \pgls{pc} has 5 \glspl{hp}, they can march for 3 miles in the morning, then rest and recuperate 3 \glspl{ep} over midday, then do the same over evening and night.

Of course, if the rest of the troupe have more stamina, they might have to march further to keep up.
A smaller person, marching 8 miles in the morning would gain 4 \glspl{ep}, then heal only 3 over the next rest.
Each day they would accumulate 2 more \glspl{ep} in total.

Travelling by road means the troupe can usually sleep in \pgls{village}, \pgls{broch} or at least \pgls{bothy}, so it affords more opportunity for rest.

\makeAutoRule{cold}{Cold Seasons}{gain 2~\glsfmtlongpl{ep} each \glsfmttext{interval} and need fire to rest}
\index{Winter}
\index{Cold Seasons}
\index{Snow}
During the colder seasons of \gls{Alassea} and \gls{Minquesta}, the frigid air inflicts 4~\glspl{ep} each \gls{interval}, or 2~\glspl{ep} for characters wearing warm clothing.

Characters can only rest with a fire, which may attract monsters (usually a 1 in 6 chance).

\makeRule{navigate_land}{Navigating on land}{Intelligence}{Wyldcrafting}{by terrain type, Failure Margin adds 2 miles}
\index{Navigation}
\index{Marching}
\index{Travel!Navigation}

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Mountains are \tn[8].
  \item
    Forests are \tn[11].
  \item
    Marshes are \tn[12].
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Each failure margin adds 2 miles to the journey time, so when trying to find a particular house somewhere in a forest, 10 miles away, the \gls{tn} would be 12.
If the roll is an 8, the actual journey would be 18 miles.

\makeRule{navigate_ocean}{Navigation open oceans}{Intelligence}{Seafaring}{12}
\index{Sailing!Navigation}

\makeRule{run_in_dark}{Running in the Dark}{Wits}{Caving}{12}
\index{Spelunking!Running in the dark}%
A torch adds a +3 Bonus.
A tie means the character comes to a sudden halt, without Damage.
Failure means $1D6$ Damage, plus the character's Speed (running faster means more Damage).
\index{Darkness!Running}

\makeRule{place_fire}{Placing Fire Undergound}{Intelligence}{Caving}{11 to avoid filling the cavern with smoke, and receiving 2~\glsfmtlongpl{ep} per \glsentrytext{interval}}
A fire in the wrong place underground can easily choke everyone around to death, or at least until they can't think properly.
Of course, this provides an excellent weapon of war if one can do it properly.
Light the wrong type of fire, and heavy smoke will fall down a tunnel instead of rising.
\index{Spelunking!Placing Fire}

Failure indicates nearby characters suffer 2~\glspl{ep}, and everyone in the area suffers \pgls{ep} each round after that.

\makeRule{start_fire}{Starting a Fire}{Intelligence}{Wyldcrafting}{10}
A little tinder-box will grant a +2 Bonus, and heavier boxes will allow reuse.
During the cold seasons, fire is a necessity to remove \glspl{ep} (mentioned \vpageref[above]{cold}).

\makeRule{swimming}{Swimming}{Speed}{Seafaring}{set by water speed}

The \gls{tn} depends on the water's speed -- large rivers might have a \gls{tn} of 8, while an open sea in a storm might be \gls{tn} 12.
\index{Swimming}

Characters can swim 1 \gls{step} per \gls{ap} spent.
If they do nothing but swimming, they can add their Athletics Skill to the total at the end of the round.

\makeRule{tracking}{Tracking}{Wits}{Wyldcrafting}{12}\index{Tracking}
Excessive snow or rain means the \gls{tn} decreases by 2 due to mud or snow remembering every step.
However, it also increases the \gls{tn} by 2 each \gls{interval}.

Both the hunter and the hunted determine their rate of travel.
The hunter continues making roll until they catch their quarry or lose them.

\makeRule{walk_underground}{Walking Underground}{Dexterity}{Caving}{8, plus 2 per mile}\index{Spelunking!Walking}
Caverns offer all manner of impediments, from sudden drops to falling debris, and passages full of water.

\caveTravelChart
Each mile covered inflicts 2 \glspl{ep} -- double the usual.
Each \gls{interval}, the \glspl{pc} decide how many miles they wish to cover, and make a roll.
Proper equipment, such as ropes, good shoes, and a map, can add up to a +3 Bonus.

Failure results in an additional 3~\glspl{ep}, as the characters bang their head, twist an ankle, or bruise their arse on slippery fall.
A tie means they can see the danger coming, and choose to rest instead of taking the \glspl{ep}, then carrying on with a plan for the route.

\index{Intimidation}

\makeRule{scout}{Scouting for an enemy camp}{Speed}{Vigilance}{9 plus the enemy's \roll{Wits}{Vigilance}}
A tie indicates someone spotted you before you got away.
Failure indicates not getting away.

\subsection{Patterns in the Rules}

Noticing patterns in the rules can help you to remember them.
Make the following principles a habit, and you'll find your role becomes a lot easier.
And speaking of rolls, let's start with dice stats, and why `7' is the magic number.

\vspace{10pt}
\noindent
\begin{scriptsize}%
\begin{boxtable}[clXX]

  \hline
  \textbf{Roll} & \textbf{Combinations} & \textbf{Chance} & \textbf{or Greater} \\\hline
  2  & \epsdice{1}\epsdice{1} & 2.78\% & 100\% \\
  3  & \epsdice{1}\epsdice{2} \epsdice{2}\epsdice{1} & 5.56\% & 97.22\% \\
  4  & \epsdice{1}\epsdice{3} \epsdice{3}\epsdice{1} \epsdice{2}\epsdice{2} & 8.33\% & 91.67\% \\
  5  & \epsdice{1}\epsdice{4} \epsdice{4}\epsdice{1} \epsdice{2}\epsdice{3} \epsdice{3}\epsdice{2}  & 11.11\% & 83.33\% \\
  6  & \epsdice{1}\epsdice{5} \epsdice{5}\epsdice{1} \epsdice{2}\epsdice{4} \epsdice{4}\epsdice{2} \epsdice{3}\epsdice{3} & 13.89\% & 72.22\% \\
  7  & \epsdice{1}\epsdice{6} \epsdice{6}\epsdice{1} \epsdice{2}\epsdice{5} \epsdice{5}\epsdice{2} \epsdice{3}\epsdice{4} \epsdice{4}\epsdice{3} & 16.67\% & 58.33\% \\
  8  & \epsdice{2}\epsdice{6} \epsdice{6}\epsdice{2} \epsdice{3}\epsdice{5} \epsdice{5}\epsdice{3} \epsdice{4}\epsdice{4} & 13.89\% & 41.67\% \\
  9  & \epsdice{3}\epsdice{6} \epsdice{6}\epsdice{3} \epsdice{4}\epsdice{5} \epsdice{5}\epsdice{4} & 11.11\% & 27.78\% \\
  10 & \epsdice{4}\epsdice{6} \epsdice{6}\epsdice{4} \epsdice{5}\epsdice{5} & 8.33\% & 16.67\% \\
  11 & \epsdice{5}\epsdice{6} \epsdice{6}\epsdice{5} & 5.56\% & 8.33\% \\
  12 & \epsdice{6}\epsdice{6} & 2.78\% & 2.78\% \\

\end{boxtable}
\end{scriptsize}

\paragraph{Always round up} -- whether someone is helping another character with half their Bonus, or combat calls for half Damage, or just any time someone divides a number, they round up at 0.5.
One quarter of a +1 bonus is still 0, but half of a +3 bonus is always +2.

Every rule in the book keeps to this pattern, so you will never have to wonder about which rules round up, and which down.
You always round up.

\paragraph{Dangerous actions are not Resting actions}
so if someone has to get this spell just right the first time, or judge the chances of a cave-in and commit to a particular tunnel, they do not get a resting action, even if they have a couple of moments (or months) to spare.

If a task must succeed first time, it's not a resting action!

\paragraph{It's only a Team Roll when working together helps.}
Writing as a group might seem fun, but it won't always help, so writing a play would not normally allow for a Team Roll.
And if the players ask to make a team roll to craft a fantastic statue, reply `no'.
Master carvers don't ask for help chiselling their statues, so the roll has to be a Group Roll, i.e. the lowest score can drag everyone down.

Conversely, anyone building a basic raft would welcome all the help they can get.
This shows that the group should be allowed a Team Roll.

\paragraph{When in doubt, set the \glsentrytext{tn} high!}
\Gls{tn} 7 may seem like an standard, but it functions more like a basic number to add to.
A professional \gls{npc} would normally have a Skill at +2, and some relevant Attribute at +1 (at least), along with the Specialist Knack,%
\footnote{See page \pageref{specialist}.}
which grants a +2 bonus.
That leaves professionals with at least a +5 Bonus to do their job.
And if they can take a Resting Action to do their job, they will roll at least 12 every time.
Therefore, \gls{tn} 12 isn't monstrously high -- it represents a starting figure for basic professionals doing what professionals do.
And if the \emph{average} professional would struggle with a task, then a \gls{tn} of 14 or more fits fine!

\paragraph{The dice tell the story,} but only with interpretation.
A crappy roll to open a door suggests the massive door has wedged properly shut.
A fantastic roll to talk to the local lord might indicate he has family in that character's home \gls{village}.
Explaining dice results can come easier than making up a situation whole-cloth.

\Gls{fenestra} runs on deterministic mechanics -- nothing occurs because of `luck'.
Traits represent reliable elements of the world (such as a character's Strength), while the dice represent unknown elements, such as the wind or the movements of animals.

If you interpret the dice rolls as just how well a character has performed that day, a lot of the system will stop making sense; when one \gls{pc} `just fails' to convince \pgls{warden} to fund their mission, another might step in to `try their luck' (with the dice).
But if the first player to roll understands that the town \gls{warden}'s raging toothache has put him in a foul mood, the rest should understand that the result (or at least the roll) will remain no matter who tries to speak with him.
This leaves room for some other \gls{pc}, with better stats, to succeed in the endeavour (by using the same roll), but does not encourage a ring of players rolling dice like a bunch of bored gamblers.

\subsubsection{Everything is a Mirror}

\begin{exampletext}
  The guard sprints towards the archer, dodging his arrows.
  With Speed +1 and Athletics +2, she has a +3 bonus.
  The \gls{gm} gives a \gls{tn} of `9'.
\end{exampletext}

\noindent
Here, the \gls{pc} playing the guard can roll a total of 6 numbers which show a win, and 4 which result in failure.

However, from time to time, the \gls{gm} may want to roll dice, either to emphasise an enemy's agency, or to keep players from having to spend too long throwing Mathsrocks across the table.

\begin{exampletext}
  The archer looses another arrow towards the guard.
  With Dexterity +0 and Projectiles +2, he has a +2 bonus.
  The \gls{gm} rolls against a \gls{tn} of `7' plus the player's bonuses, for a total \gls{tn} of `10'.
\end{exampletext}

\noindent
This might look different at a glance, but of course the archer wins on the top 4 numbers, and loses on the lower 6.
Mechanically, the same roll has occurred in each instance.

\section{Rolling for the Role}
\label{rollForRoles}

\begin{multicols}{2}

\noindent
It's hard to play `the social character'.
You put all your \glspl{xp} into a high Charisma score because you want to build alliances and understand people, then the \gls{gm} asks you to roleplay such an encounter and your natural stutter and slow wit replace the social graces your character should have.

It's also hard playing a non-social character.
You have been lumped with a character with a Charisma Penalty of -4 and by all the gods you intend to roleplay it, so it's time to ask the town \gls{warden} which lady he stole his robe from and then wipe your mouth with the tablecloth.
But the other players are not impressed; all they can see is someone intentionally ruining the encounter rather than the fun-loving, amazing improviser that you are.

Consider the following solution: when players want their character to speak, \gls{gm} tells them to roll \roll{Charisma}{Empathy} or \roll{Wits}{Whatever}, then sets the \gls{tn} for the encounter.
The dice determine the results, but the player \emph{interprets} the dice.

\subsubsection{Interpretation over Performance}

When players roll high on a social encounter, they get to set the scene.
They may take it as an opportunity for a grand speech, or may prefer to simply describe loosely how the event goes, and leave it at that.

Asking for `roleplaying' in order to make an encounter go smoothly tells players never to interpret failures, which is a great loss.

\begin{quotation}
  Rolling a total of `1' won't get you into the keep.
  What exactly does Corbelch say to the guards?
\end{quotation}

This method of players rolling before roleplaying to indicate their roll gives value to the social characters' Traits and legitimacy to the antics of more socially clumsy players saying all the wrong things.
The roll of the dice also acts as a way of saying `I am about to speak', so people can pace conversation without interruption.

\section*{The Right to Improve}

\begin{multicols}{2}

This book has problems, and that's fine.
I've put this under a share-alike licence,\footnote{\tt GNU General Public License 3 or (at your option) any later version.} so anyone can grab a copy of the basic \LaTeX~ document it's written in and make improvements.
This isn't the Open Gaming Licence of D20 where they magnanimously allow you to use their word for a mechanic and let you publish things for their products -- this is a publicly owned book.

No longer do imaginative Games Masters have to scribble their inspired house rules onto the back of an old banking statement and Sellotape it to the last page of the core book.
Instead, you have the complete source documents, and can modify it as you please, creating a cohesive book.
If you spot an error, you can correct it.
If you want to add a couple of spells, it's no problem.
Just copy the \href{https://gitlab.com/bindrpg/core}{source files}, download a \LaTeX~ editor, and make the changes you want.
Once you're happy with your changes, you might even send it off to a printing shop for a copy of your own version.

And if you happen to make some useful additions, or even deletions, be sure to add them to another git project, where others can benefit from your genius.

With a little work, we could get a real community-based RPG.
Something that's always free, something that gets a new edition as and when people want, with just the changes that people want -- a continuously evolving work.

This particular version was last revised on \today.
